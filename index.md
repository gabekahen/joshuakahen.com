### Where is Joshua?

Being unable to walk, Joshua is likely wherever his parents last left him. Undoubtably, this will be somewhere within the home.

### Does Joshua Have (any more) Teeth?

Joshua already possesses all of his [baby teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth); though at time of writing, only two have erupted from his lower gumline.

### Is Joshua..

#### .. Talking?

Joshua is still pre-verbal, but has aquired a small repertoire of noises he can effectively reproduce, including:
- Clicking (tongue)
- Farting (lips)
- Squealing 

#### .. Crawling?

Joshua is not yet capable of linear motion, but has reliably rolled himself sideways for short distances.

#### .. Standing?

No, Joshua is not yet able to stand on his own two feet. If Joshua is upright, it is because he is being held up by one of his parents.

#### .. Walking?

See [Standing](#-standing), above.

#### .. On His Stomach?

If Joshua's back is parallel to the ground with his face down, Joshua may be on his stomach.

#### .. Asleep?

If his eyes are closed, Joshua is likely asleep. Joshua will often open his eyes if he is awake, but may close them for a few seconds at a time.

#### .. Naked?

Although Joshua does have clothes, he does at times go without them. If a large amount of Joshua's skin is exposed to view, he is likely not wearing any clothes (naked).

#### .. Touching, Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling?

Presumably, though he has not directly conveyed his experience of these senses to us - see [Talking](#-talking).
